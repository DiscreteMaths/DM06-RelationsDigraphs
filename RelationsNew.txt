If S is a set, we will use the symbol “R” to denote either an abstract relation or a speci?c
relation for which there is no standard notation. For a, b \in S we will write a R b, not
(a, b) \in R, to indicate that a and b are related.

\begin{itemize}
\item De?nition 1: Let R be a relation of a set S. We say that R is re?exive provided for all
a \in S, a R a.

\item De?nition 2: Let R be a relation of a set S. We say that R is symmetric provided for
all a, b \in S, if a R b then b R a.

\item De?nition 3: Let R be a relation of a set S. We say that R is transitive provided for
all a, b, c \in S, if a R b and b R c then a R c.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exercise}
For a, b \in Z de?ne a R b to mean that a divides b.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] State whether or not R is re?exive.
\item[(b)] State whether or not R is symmetric.
\item[(c)] State whether or not R is transitive.
\end{itemize}
Solution: 

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  Since 0 does not divide 0, therefore R is not re?exive.
\item[(b)] 2 divides 4 so 2 R 4. But 4 does not divide 2, so 4 R 2. Thus, R is not symmetric.
\item[(c)]  To see that R is transitive, let a, b, c be integers. Suppose that a R b and b R c. Thus,
a divides b and b divides c so there exist integers k and l such that b = ak and c = bl. This
gives c = bl = (ak)l = a(kl). Therefore, a divides c so a R c
\end{itemize}
