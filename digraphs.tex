\subsection*{Directed Graphs}
A directed graph or digraph is a graph, or set of nodes connected by edges, where the edges have a direction associated with them. In formal terms a digraph is a pair $G=(V,A)$(sometimes $G=(V,E)$) of a set $V$, whose elements are called vertices or nodes, and a set $A$ of ordered pairs of vertices, called arcs, directed edges, or arrows (and sometimes simply 'edges' with the corresponding set named E instead of A).
