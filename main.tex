\section*{Question 6}

\subsection*{Part A : Digraphs}

Suppose $A = \{1,2,3,4\}$. Consider the following relation in A

\[ \{  (1,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(4,2),(4,4)\} \]

Draw the direct graph of $A$. Based on the Digraph of $A$ discuss whether or not a relation that could be depicted by the digraph could be described as the following, justifying your answer.


\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Symmetric
\item[(ii)] Reflexive 
\item[(iii)] Transitive
\item[(iv)] Antisymmetric
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Part B : Relations}
Determine which of the following relations $ x R y$ are reflexive, transitive, symmetric, or antisymmetric on the following - there may be more than one characteristic.  if

\begin{itemize} 
\item[(i)] $x = y$
\item[(ii)] $x < y$
\item[(iii)] $x^2 = y^2$
\item[(iv)] $x \geq y$
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Part C : Partial Orders}
% http://staff.scem.uws.edu.au/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/zhuhan/dmath/dm_readall.cgi?page=20

Let $A=\{0,1,2\}$ and $R=\{ (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,1), (1,2), (2,2)\}$
and $S=\{(0,0),(1,1),(2,2)\}$ be 2 relations on A. Show that

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] R is a partial order relation.
\item[(ii)] S is an equivalence relation.
\end{itemize}

% 2007 Q8
Given a flock of chickens, between any two chickens one of them is
dominant. A relation, R, is defined between chicken x and chicken y as xRy if x is
dominant over y. This gives what is known as a pecking order to the flock. Home
Farm has 5 chickens: Amy, Beth, Carol, Daisy and Eve, with the following relations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Amy is dominant over Beth and Carol
\item Beth is dominant over Eve and Carol
\item Carol is dominant over Eve and Daisy
\item Daisy is dominant over Eve, Amy and Beth
\item Eve is dominant over Amy.
\end{itemize}
